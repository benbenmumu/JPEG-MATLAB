# JPEG-MATLAB
  A basic JPEG system writen by MATLAB. It includes the DCT and iDCT, the quantification and inverse quantification, the Huffman code and decode.
  The test image shuold be a grayscale image with width and heigth is the multiplier of 8.
  When you use this program to encode a grayscale image, you will get a string with '0' and '1'. I use it represent the binary code. Meanwhile, the decode input shuold be a string with '0' and '1', and you will get a grayscale image.
